# Reaktor23 cashdesk

We had just a whiteboard for a very long time to keep track of our drink consumptions and it was about time to get a new solution!
So we built a web app called **cashdesk** 

It is based on trust, so we do not have a login or other means of authentication in place.

You select your account on the landing page

In the account details you see your funds, the logs of your vends, your deposits and two buttons for vending a drink and toping up your account.

A click on vend lets you select a drink that then gets subtracted from your funds.

A click on deposit lets you top up your account.
